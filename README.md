# 🍔 Swiggy Delivery Time Prediction

An end-to-end **Machine Learning project** that predicts food delivery time using real-world Swiggy order data.
The system analyzes multiple order-related factors and provides an estimated delivery duration to improve **customer experience and logistics efficiency**.

## 📌 Project Overview

* Cleaned and preprocessed raw Swiggy delivery dataset
* Performed **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to identify key delivery-time factors
* Built a **regression-based ML model** for delivery time prediction
* Saved the trained model and integrated it into a **Python prediction application**

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **Python**
* **Pandas, NumPy**
* **Scikit-learn**
* **Jupyter Notebook**
* **Streamlit (for deployment)
